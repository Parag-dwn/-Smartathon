## Project Description:
Project to simulate the human learning experience in the context of picture identification for the classification of visual pollutants. We will be Building Image Classification model using Neural Network. The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that can identify various types of images. This model will be able to accurately classify images based on their content, allowing for a better and more accurate search experience. The project will involve training the model on a large dataset of images, which will include labeled images of various objects, animals, and scenes. The model will be trained using a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. First, the model will be trained on a labeled dataset of images, where each image is labeled with its class. This will allow the model to learn the features that distinguish each class from other classes. Then, the model will be trained on an unlabeled dataset of images, where the model will learn to recognize patterns within the images. This will allow the model to identify images based on patterns and features, rather than relying solely on labels. Once the model is trained, it will be tested on a test dataset of images to evaluate its performance. The model will be evaluated based on its accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Once the model has achieved satisfactory performance on the test dataset, it will be deployed and
Built with: Python, numpy,pandas,open cv,matplotlib, tensorflow , sklearn.
